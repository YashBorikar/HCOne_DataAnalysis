# Data Analytical and Forecasting Solutions for Job Applicant Success Prediction at HC-One

HC-One is the largest care home operator in the UK and looks after around 13.5 thousand people across 280 homes. However, the organization faces a significant challenge in managing the high volume of job applications they receive each week, primarily for care workers and nurses, with numbers ranging between 2,500-3,000 applications.

To address this challenge, I developed analytical and forecasting solutions to indicate the likely success of job applicants. The project targeted a variety of technical artefacts, ranging from exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations, and dashboards to clustering and predictive modelling.

The project aims to provide HC-One with a more efficient and effective way of processing job applications, ultimately helping them to identify the best candidates for their care homes. By leveraging a range of data analysis techniques, the project seeks to improve the selection process for job applicants and enhance the overall hiring process for the organization.

Technical Artefacts
1. Exploratory data analysis: To analyze and visualize the data and identify any patterns, trends, or relationships.
2. Interactive visualizations and dashboards: To provide HC-One with an easy-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing the data.
2. Clustering: To group job applicants based on their characteristics and skills.
3. Predictive modelling: To develop a predictive model that can forecast the success of job applicants based on their qualifications and skills.

The use of these technical artefacts aims to provide HC-One with actionable insights that can help the organization make informed decisions about the hiring process.
